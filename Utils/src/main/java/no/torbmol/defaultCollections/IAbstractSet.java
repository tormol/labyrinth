/**
 * This interface provides a skeletal implementation of the <tt>Set</tt>
 * interface to minimize the effort required to implement this
 * interface. <p>
 *
 * The process of implementing a set by implementing this interface is identical
 * to that of implementing a Collection by implementing IAbstractCollection,
 * except that all of the methods and constructors in subclasses of this
 * interface must obey the additional constraints imposed by the <tt>Set</tt>
 * interface (for instance, the add method must not permit addition of
 * multiple instances of an object to a set).<p>
 *
 * Note that this interface does not override any of the implementations from
 * the <tt>IAbstractCollection</tt> interface.  It merely adds implementations
 * for <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt>.<p>
 *
 * As interfaces cannot provide implementations for Object method like equals(Object), hashCode() and toString(),
 * those have been moved to DefaultCollections.set
 * This interface is a member of the DefaultCollections package.
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements maintained by this set

     * set so that its value is the <i>asymmetric set difference</i> of
     * the two sets.
     *
     * <p>This implementation determines which is the smaller of this set
     * and the specified collection, by invoking the <tt>size</tt>
     * method on each.  If this set has fewer elements, then the
     * implementation iterates over this set, checking each element
